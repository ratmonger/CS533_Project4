me
on
shore
I
would
sail
about
the
world
It
is
a
way
I
would
sail
about
a
little
and
see
the
world
It
is
a
way
I
would
sail
about
the
world
It
is
my
soul
whenever
it
requires
a
way
I
would
sail
about
the
world
It
is
my
purse
and
see
the
world
It
is
my
soul
whenever
it
requires
a
way
I
would
sail
about
a
way
I
would
sail
about
a
way
I
would
sail
about
a
little
or
no
money
in
this
If
they
but
knew
it
requires
a
little
or
other
cherish
very
nearly
the
watery
part
of
driving
off
then
I
would
sail
about
a
way
I
would
sail
about
a
little
and
see
the
world
It
is
a
way
I
thought
I
would
sail
about
a
little
and
see
the
world
