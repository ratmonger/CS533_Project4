This folder containsThe files used for creating generated Text Files. I have included the original files and files generated based on those files.
To create a text file Run MarkovTextGenerator.m
Input variables : Input files name(The reference text file) Output file name (File to be generated) and seedWord, which needs to be a word in the reference text.
All punctuation is removed from reference text file
No punctuation in output text file
Output file is the same number of words as reference file.
A dictionary is created for each different word(base word) from the reference text file 
The dictionary entries are each word following(following word) the base word with the probability that the particular following word will occure after the given base word in the original text.
When generating the text the seed word is placed a the first word of the generated text file output(GTFO).
The next word in the GTFO is chosed from the following word dictionary for that base word based on th eprobabilities associated with the following words.
This process is reapeated until the file contains an identical number of words as the reference text.
